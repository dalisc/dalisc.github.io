          Hey there! I'm Dalis. I'm a Year 3 computer science undergrad at the
          National University of Singapore. I love programming, especially web
          development. I am currently interning as a Software Engineer at
          Pawjourr x TWA for the 2020 summer. I love picking up new programming
          skills and through this internship, two new things I am learning are
          ReactJS and GraphQL. Read on more to find out what I do at school and
          in my spare time!

              For the Daimler Empowering Mobility Challenge, my team and I
              pitched an idea for smartcars to help detect unreported road
              accidents. Our idea made it to the finals for which I prototyped a
              video analytics engine to detect vehicle accidents and plot
              accident hotspots on the map, using Django, Google Video
              Intelligence API, OpenWeatherMap API, and Mapbox. (Unfortunately,
              this repository was required to be private, but you can view our

              This personalized recommendation engine was developed for a
              virtual hackathon organised by Circles.Life. It uses collaborative
              filtering to cluster similar users together and content-based
              filtering to recommend specific items to users in a cluster. We
              used various APIs to do semantic analysis on event and movie
              descriptions to see how closely they match users' existing tastes
              and preferences. We were very proud to win the Most Innovative
              Award and the Diversity & Inclusion Award.

              believe it when we became the Rakuten Rapid API Challenge Winner!

              This was the first app I developed with React. I created this as

              YouTube Cat is a Chrome plugin developed by me and my friend
              Arjavi as a 2019 summer project. It allows you to specify what
              categories of videos you want to block on YouTube, so that you can
              fine tune your desired level of productivity! We used React for
              the front-end and Firestore for the backend. Arjavi took care of
              that. I mainly wrote the javascript logic behind the app!

          I am currently interning at Pawjourr x TWA as a Software Engineer.
          Pawjourr is an up-and-coming pet e-commerce. It is the child startup
          of the successful pet-influencer marketing startup The Woof Agency.
          Currently we are moving the Pawjourr e-commerce platform from Shopify
          to our own tech stack. While my internship supervisor is building the
          new Pawjourr client web app, I am building the internal content
          management system. We are using the MERN stack but something new we're
          incorporating is GraphQL and Tailwind CSS, which are AMAZING
          frameworks!

          This was my first developer internship and it was abraod too, so you
          could imagine my excitement! 9cv9 is a career platform startup that
          aims to connect students, fresh grads, and junior job-seekers to tech
          jobs and internships. At the startup, I worked on creating components
          for their new job referral system Jobsrefer using Vue.js. I also
          helped the backend team to create REST API services using Django. In
          addition, I used Django to create a fullstack payroll management
          system web application as part of the intra-company hackathon among
          the interns. Moreover, I was tasked with writing weekly tech articles
          on Medium. Writing these articles increased my understanding of the
          tech stack that we were using in the internship too. Here are some
          articles that I'm proud of:

        <h1><i class="fas fa-camera-retro"></i> My Interests & Hobbies</h1>
        <p>
          In my spare time I love playing tennis! I started learning when I was
          about 12 back in my home country Cambodia. After coming to Singapore,
          I played in my high school team and while I was at Tembusu College I
          played with the college team too! Another thing I love is Netflix.
          When I want to relax, Netflix and my bed are my go-to place.
          Otherwise, I'd take out my guitar and start strumming!
        </p>
        <p>
          One hobby I really wish to pick up is SCUBA diving! In the summer of
          2019 when I was living in Indonesia, I did a fun dive in the Gili
          islands and instantly fell in love with the underwater world. You're
          weightless, probably much like floating in space... When travel
          becomes somewhat normal again I plan to get my SCUBA licenses and go
          diving anywhere I can afford.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, last summer, I also bought an old film camera and just pointed
          and shoot stuff. Here are some pictures that developed quite nicely!
          There was one roll where I accidentally used the same roll twice and
          had some accidental double exposures.
